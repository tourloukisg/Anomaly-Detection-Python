   The scope of this work is to demonstrate the use of machine learning (ML) models for the detection of anomalies (fraudulent transactions) based on the records/samples of a multi-dimensional 'Credit Card' dataset. The dataset comprises a 'Time' feature (transaction time interval in sec.,where 't'='t_current'- 't_first=0'), 28 'credit card user' features (V1-V28, part of PCA dimensionality reduction to protect the user personal information), the transaction 'Amount' feature and the 'Class' feature, that is of binary type, which represents the type of transaction : a)nonfraudulent(inliers) and b) fraudulent(outliers).

   Initially,an exploratory data analysis is provided in order to extract useful information from  selected credit card transaction dataset columns (e.g.'Time','Amount','Class' and 'user' features) with the help of data visualization techniques (i.e. pie & bar charts, count/ distribution/ box/  scatter plots). The scope of the EDA is to uncover meaningful insights related to fraudulent credit card transactions such as a) the total number of records  per 'Class' ('Nonfraudulent'/Fraudulent transactions--> balanced/unbalanced dataset), b) the  'Amount' feature density estimation/distribution in terms of the outlier samples (i.e.maximum, minimum ,median transaction amount), c) the 'Time' feature distribution and related statistics when grouped at different time intervals, d) Correlation of all dataset features with the 'Amount' feature and e) The samples distribution (spread of data) of the strongest/weakest correlated dataset features with respect to  fraudulent transaction amount.
   
   In the second part of this demonstration, Sampling(30%) is applied to the 'credit card' dataset so as to reduce the time that is required to perform the upcoming computational processes due to its original large size. In order to determine whether a transaction is fraudulent or not, two unsupervised anonaly detection machine learning algorithms are employed: a) the Local Outlier Factor (Based on the nearest neighbor technique) and b) the Isolation Forest (Based on the principles of ensemble methods that use combinations of Decision Trees/Random Forest algorithm). The sampled dataset is split into training samples and labels, where the training samples are fitted to each machine learning model to compute whether each sample is considered an inlier (nonfradulent transaction) or outlier(fraudulent transaction) and at the end the predictions are compared with the actual labels so as to evaluate the ML models performance (score metrics: classification_report-confusion matrix ).
